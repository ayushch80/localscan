## HOW DID I GOT IDEA
I got idea while testing something on a local chain hosted from `geth`.

## WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
Like there's a block explorer for every popular sidechain/sidenet of Ethereum but there is only one block explorer for local chains i.e. `Ganache` so i decided to make a block explorer for custom RPC endpoints
